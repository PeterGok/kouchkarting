# KouchKarting

The game that I made in my Grade 11 Computer Science class. Simply compile and run KouchKarting.java found in the src/application folder.

This application includes a part of the GLApp library that I used to get access to the OpenGL API.

In this application I created custom 3D graphics in 3ds Max and custom textures for those objects in Illustrator. I then used a small framework created by napier@potatoland.org for an app and extended it to a full-scale video game.
